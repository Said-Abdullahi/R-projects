# R-projects
This repository contains a collection of my R projects, showcasing practical applications in data analysis, visualisation, and statistical modeling. Each project highlights different R packages and techniques, such as tidyverse, ggplot2, shiny, and more. These projects demonstrate how R can be used to solve real-world data problems, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to predictive modeling.

Explore this repository to gain insights into R's powerful capabilities and learn how to apply them to your own projects.
